# Stellar trash

This is the main repository for our START Hack challenge. It is divided into ### sections.

## Code

The repository with the code is available at https://github.com/Ubax/bulk-waste-calculator. It includes instructions how to setup the environment and build the final website. There is also basic description of code, future improvement ideas and instructions for implementing changes.

The website can be tested at https://ubax.github.io/stellar-trash/

## Our solution

Our solution consist of four subsystems working together to provide full solution.

    Calc[Calculator] --> Payment[Payment system] --> Listing[Offers listing]
    Payment --> Collector[Collector application]
```

**Calculator** is already implemented part, that can be easily embedded into any existing website. It lets users estimate the number of stamps needed for their waste in a quick and efficient way.

**Payment system** will be an easy to use platform to buy digital stamps. Based on the previous calculations it will

**Offers listing** will be a website to check all the working objects that people want to throw away. It will present the address and the date for pickup.

**Collector application** will be mobile application used by the collectors to validate the digital stamps.
